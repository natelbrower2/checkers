# Overview

This is a Checkers game that was made in Python using the Pygame extension. I made this game to get a better idea of how game software is made. 

The Checkers game is played using the mouse. The user selects the piece that they would like to move and then the spots that that piece can move to will be highlighted in green. Once the user selects a highlighted grid position, the checkers piece will be moved.

The purpose of creating this software was for me to learn more about game framework and what it takes to make game software.

# Development Environment

To develop this software, I used Visual Studio Code, Python, the Pygame extension, Git, and GitHub.

I used Python as my programming language as well as the Pygame extension for this program.

# Future Work

In the future, I would like to do the following to improve this program:
* Implement the option to perform a double jump
* Create a robot that can play agains the user to make a single player option available
* Create an end game screen to tell the user who has won the game
